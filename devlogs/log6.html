					<p>This week was a focus on a final external playtest before polishing our game for the 
						first rollout. First, here are the details of the playtesting over the course of the 
						last two weeks. 
					</p>

					<h3 class="mt-3 mb-3">Playtest 1</h3>

					<p>We implemented the paper prototype level with player controls including moving left 
						and right, jumping, dashing, and gliding. 
					</p>

					<p>Overall, it seemed like people had fun playing our game and enjoyed the art style. 
						However, there were complaints about the unintuitive control mapping. They also 
						thought the camera was too zoomed in and didnâ€™t show much of the environment, so we 
						fixed that for the next playtest. Furthermore, we had some complaints that there 
						was no double jump ability. Finally, the cooldown was too long to understand when 
						the abilities were unusable.
					</p>

				    <h3 class="mt-3 mb-3">Playtest 2</h3>

					<p>Here we continued to add features. We add the double jump ability as well as added 
						more animations to make it clear that the player is doing different actions. We 
						also changed some aesthetics such as the background, ability indicator, and some 
						terrain changes. We also shortened the cooldown time.
					</p>

					<figure style="text-align: center;">
						<img class="img-fluid" src="../assets/images/devlogs/log6-abilityindicator.png"/>
						<figcaption>Ability Indicator</figcaption>
					</figure>

					<p>This time, we had the controls written out on a paper so that there would be less 
						questions about the controls. Players still found them confusing though, including 
						not being able to double jump by hitting the same key twice. Moreover, they felt 
						that everything done with the left hand was a bit too crowded. 
					</p>

					<p>We also had a bug with movement where landing from a fall would momentarily stop 
						the player, so we needed to fix that. Despite the issues, it seemed like players 
						still enjoyed playing our game.
					</p>

				    <h3 class="mt-3 mb-3">Playtest 3</h3>

					<p>At this point, we already began prepping for our rollout. We implemented the first 
						two levels, where level 1 is a proper tutorial. We also added a shield ability, 
						damaging terrain, and health system. We continued fixing some aesthetics like 
						animations and an ability orb to follow the player. Finally, we made a large 
						change with the controls mapping, including changing it from mainly one-handed to 
						two-handed. 
					</p>

					<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap;">
						<div style="flex: 50%; padding: 0 4px; text-align: center;">
							<figure>
								<img class="img-fluid" style="background-color: #414141;"
									src="../assets/images/devlogs/log6-iconDash.png"/>
								<figcaption>Dash Icon</figcaption>

						</div>
						<div style="flex: 50%; padding: 0 4px; text-align: center;">

									src="../assets/images/devlogs/log6-iconDoubleJump.png"/>
								<figcaption>Double Jump Icon</figcaption>
							</figure>
						</div>
					</div>

					<p>Players liked the art, ability system, environment, and player character. Overall 
						some of the controls were still a bit unintuitive (e.g., double jump), and there 
						were some bugs with shield or otherwise confusing aspects such as the death pits 
						and spikes. Furthermore, the levels may be better lengthened with a checkpoint 
						system. 
					</p>

					<h3 class="mt-3 mb-3">Onwards</h3>

					<p>From here, we took what we learned from the player preferences to improve our game 
						before rollout. We remapped the levels and took at the shield ability to be 
						acquired once level 3 is in place. We also implemented a checkpoint system and 
						clearer icons for the abilities in the tutorial. To continue, we added sound 
						effects to help add redundancy to the feedback the player received when moving or 
						using abilities. Finally, we added a main menu which lets players choose one of two 
						control schemes. 
					</p>

					<p>With the new additions, we updated the trailer! You can watch it below.

					</div>

					<br/>

					<p>We are looking forward to seeing how the players will enjoy our game during the 
						first rollout and in the meantime will begin working on the next level! We plan to 
						fix the shield along with adding a shield-focused level for the players to continue 
						their journey. Please look forward to it!
