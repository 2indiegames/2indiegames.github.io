					<p>You may have noticed a change on our front page, but we’ve accomplished our first 
						rollout! We released the first two levels which consist of a tutorial and a level 
						using the dash and double jump abilities. In the build, we also implemented 
						analytics logging so that we can monitor how players are fairing in our game. The 
						types of data we logged were player input, ability usage, game events, chosen 
						control scheme, and other general statistics.
					</p>

					<p>Here are three interesting data summaries we found for data over the first 48 hours 
						of release.
					</p>

					<figure style="text-align: center;">
						<img class="img-fluid" src="../assets/images/devlogs/log7-time.png"/>
					</figure>

					<p>Most players took under 10 minutes to play. This is our expected time range. 
						However, two players took over 100 minutes to play. We suspect they may have been 
						away from the keyboard without closing the game.
					</p>

					<figure style="text-align: center;">
						<img class="img-fluid" src="../assets/images/devlogs/log7-start.png"/>
					</figure>

					<p>We had a bit of a drop off after the first level and less than half of the players 
						made it to the ending (shown as Level 3 in the graph). However, we were glad to 
						see that over two-thirds of players stayed after the tutorial. 
					</p>

					<figure style="text-align: center;">
						<img class="img-fluid" src="../assets/images/devlogs/log7-ability.png"/>
					</figure>

					<p>For our two levels, we had an expected number for ability use. The second level 
						had much more double jumps since there were larger gaps between platforms. It 
						didn’t seem like players had much difficulty utilizing the double jump ability as 
						compared to during the playtesting.
					</p>

					<p>If you would like to see more data and thoughts, please see 
						<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tySLeGuFvHuaSncNeR6GilLy1bf2yTAEbKenv8uPnpk/edit?usp=sharing">
							our presentation on rollout and analytics</a>.
					</p>

					<p>Overall, we are satisfied with how the rollout went. We built two extra levels: 
						one for dash and one for double jump. We also tuned the dash to be longer. We 
						would like to use next week as an A/B test to see how players this week versus 
						this week fared using a short or long dash. We also began building a shield level 
						as well as fixing the bug in the shield ability.
					</p>

					<p>For the next week, we plan to roll out the extra levels 1.5 and 2.5. We also plan 
						to roll out the shield levels 3 and 3.5 and will begin to implement the grow 
						ability. Finally, we begin to wrap up deliverables such as our press kit to prepare 
						for investor presentations the following week.
